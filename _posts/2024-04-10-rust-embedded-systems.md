Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety guarantees make it increasingly attractive for embedded systems. Here's what we've learned from deploying Rust in production IoT devices.

## Safety Without Compromise

Key benefits we've experienced:

- Zero runtime panics in production
- Predictable memory usage
- Compile-time error catching
- Strong concurrency guarantees

## Development Workflow

Our current embedded Rust stack:

1. Embassy for async runtime
2. Defmt for logging
3. Probe-run for debugging
4. RTIC for real-time tasks

## Resource Optimization

Critical improvements achieved:

- 30% smaller binary sizes
- Reduced power consumption
- Better interrupt handling
- More efficient memory usage

## Migration Strategy

Lessons from our C/C++ to Rust migration:

- Start with peripheral drivers
- Use FFI bridges initially
- Implement careful testing
- Maintain performance metrics

In my next post, I'll detail our custom HAL implementations that bridge Rust with vendor-specific peripherals.
