Web performance continues to be a crucial factor in user experience and SEO rankings. After optimizing several high-traffic websites this month, I wanted to share some effective techniques that have shown remarkable results.

## Core Web Vitals in 2024

Google's Core Web Vitals have become even more important this year. Here are the current thresholds you should aim for:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100 milliseconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1

## Image Optimization Strategies

One of the biggest improvements came from implementing modern image optimization techniques:

1. Using WebP with AVIF fallback
2. Implementing lazy loading
3. Utilizing CDN-based image optimization

## JavaScript Performance

Modern JavaScript frameworks have evolved, but we still need to be mindful of performance. Some key practices:

- Implement code splitting
- Use tree shaking effectively
- Consider partial hydration for SSR applications

I've seen these techniques reduce initial load times by up to 60% on several projects. The key is to measure, optimize, and measure again.

Next week, I'll dive deeper into advanced caching strategies for modern web applications.
