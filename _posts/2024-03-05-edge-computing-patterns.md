Edge computing has evolved from a buzzword to a crucial architectural pattern. After implementing edge solutions for several high-traffic applications, here are the patterns and practices that have proven most effective.

## Why Edge Computing Matters

The benefits we've observed in production:

- 50-80% reduction in TTFB (Time to First Byte)
- Improved global availability
- Reduced origin server load
- Better DDoS protection

## Effective Edge Patterns

These patterns have worked well in production:

1. Edge-side rendering for dynamic content
2. Intelligent request routing
3. Edge-based A/B testing
4. Distributed caching strategies

## Implementation Strategies

When implementing edge computing, consider:

- Use edge functions for dynamic logic
- Implement proper cache invalidation
- Handle state management carefully
- Monitor edge performance metrics

## Common Challenges

Watch out for these potential issues:

- Cold start latency
- State synchronization
- Database connection management
- Development environment parity

Next week, I'll share specific code examples for implementing these patterns using popular edge platforms.
