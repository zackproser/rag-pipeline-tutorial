Observability in microservices has evolved significantly. After managing a complex microservices environment with over 200 services, here are our key learnings about effective observability practices.

## The Three Pillars in Practice

Modern observability relies on:

- Metrics for system behavior
- Traces for request flows
- Logs for detailed debugging

## Implementing Effective Tracing

Our current stack includes:

1. OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
2. Jaeger for distributed tracing
3. Prometheus for metrics collection
4. Grafana for visualization

## Key Performance Indicators

Essential metrics we track:

- Request latency percentiles
- Error budget consumption
- Service dependencies health
- Resource utilization patterns

## Automation and Alerts

We've automated these aspects:

- Anomaly detection using ML
- Dynamic alert thresholds
- Correlation analysis
- Incident response workflows

Next post, I'll share our custom dashboards and alert configurations that have proven most valuable in production.
