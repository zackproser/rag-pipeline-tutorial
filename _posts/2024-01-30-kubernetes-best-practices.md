After managing large-scale Kubernetes clusters in production for the past year, I've gathered some valuable insights about what works and what doesn't. Here are some key lessons that could save you time and headaches.

## Resource Management

One of the most critical aspects of running Kubernetes in production is proper resource management. Always:

- Set appropriate resource requests and limits
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
- Monitor resource utilization actively

## Security Considerations

Security cannot be an afterthought. Essential practices include:

1. Using network policies to restrict pod communication
2. Implementing RBAC properly
3. Regular security scanning of container images
4. Keeping Kubernetes and all components up to date

## Monitoring and Observability

We've found this stack to be particularly effective:

- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- OpenTelemetry for tracing
- Loki for log aggregation

## Cost Optimization

Managing Kubernetes costs can be challenging. Some effective strategies we've implemented:

- Using spot instances where appropriate
- Implementing cluster autoscaling
- Regular review of resource allocation

I'll be sharing more detailed insights about our production monitoring setup in my next post.
