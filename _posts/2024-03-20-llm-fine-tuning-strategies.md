Fine-tuning Large Language Models has become more accessible, but doing it effectively still requires careful consideration. Here's what we've learned from fine-tuning models for various production use cases.

## Understanding Fine-Tuning Approaches

The landscape now offers several viable approaches:

- Full fine-tuning for comprehensive customization
- LoRA for efficient parameter updates
- QLoRA for memory-efficient training
- Prompt tuning for lightweight adaptations

## Data Preparation Best Practices

Quality training data is crucial. Our process includes:

1. Rigorous data cleaning and validation
2. Consistent formatting and templating
3. Careful prompt-completion pairing
4. Systematic quality assessment

## Resource Optimization

We've found these optimization strategies particularly effective:

- Start with smaller models for rapid iteration
- Use 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
- Implement gradient checkpointing
- Leverage parameter-efficient techniques

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Key lessons from our experience:

- Don't overtrain on limited data
- Maintain evaluation dataset diversity
- Monitor for unwanted behaviors
- Test extensively in production scenarios

Next week, I'll share detailed metrics from our recent fine-tuning projects and their real-world impact.
