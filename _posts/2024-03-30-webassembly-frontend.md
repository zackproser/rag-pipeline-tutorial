WebAssembly (Wasm) is transforming frontend development, enabling performance previously impossible in the browser. Here's how we're using it in production applications.

## Practical Use Cases

We've successfully applied Wasm for:

- Complex data visualization
- Real-time video processing
- Large dataset manipulation
- CPU-intensive calculations

## Performance Improvements

Our recent Wasm migration resulted in:

- 90% faster data processing
- Reduced memory usage
- Better battery life on mobile
- Smoother user experience

## Integration Strategies

Key approaches we've adopted:

1. Gradual migration of critical paths
2. Hybrid JavaScript/Wasm architecture
3. Shared memory optimization
4. Efficient data transfer patterns

## Development Workflow

Our optimized workflow includes:

- Rust for Wasm compilation
- Automated testing pipeline
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-browser compatibility checks

In the next post, I'll walk through building a high-performance charting library using Rust and WebAssembly.
