Deploying machine learning models to production requires careful consideration of performance, scalability, and monitoring. Here's our battle-tested approach to successful ML deployments.

## Infrastructure Considerations

Essential components of our ML stack:

- Model serving infrastructure
- Feature store implementation
- Monitoring and observability
- A/B testing framework

## Performance Optimization

Key metrics we've achieved:

1. Sub-100ms inference times
2. 99.9% availability
3. Efficient resource utilization
4. Minimal cold start latency

## Deployment Pipeline

Our automated pipeline includes:

- Model validation gates
- Canary deployments
- Automated rollbacks
- Performance regression checks

## Monitoring Strategy

Critical aspects we track:

- Model drift metrics
- Feature distribution changes
- Resource utilization
- Business KPI impact

Next week, I'll share our custom monitoring dashboard templates and alert configurations for ML deployments.
