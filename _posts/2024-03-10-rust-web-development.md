While Rust has been known for systems programming, it's increasingly becoming a compelling choice for web development. Here's why you might want to consider Rust for your next web project, and how to get started effectively.

## The Rust Web Ecosystem in 2024

The ecosystem has matured significantly, offering robust solutions for:

- HTTP servers (Axum, Actix-web)
- Database interactions (SQLx, Diesel)
- WebAssembly integration
- Full-stack frameworks (Leptos, Dioxus)

## Performance Benefits

Our team recently migrated a critical service from Node.js to Rust, achieving:

- 80% reduction in memory usage
- 95% reduction in p99 latency
- Significantly improved CPU utilization

## Getting Started

Here's a practical roadmap for web developers learning Rust:

1. Master basic Rust concepts (ownership, traits, async)
2. Start with a simple HTTP API using Axum
3. Add database integration with SQLx
4. Implement error handling patterns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Some lessons from our journey:

- Don't fight the borrow checker - design around it
- Use proper error handling from the start
- Consider compile times in your development workflow
- Leverage existing crates instead of reinventing solutions

In my next post, I'll share detailed performance comparisons between Rust and Node.js in production scenarios.
