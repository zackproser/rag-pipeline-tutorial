After implementing GraphQL Federation across dozens of microservices, we've learned valuable lessons about scaling distributed GraphQL architectures. Here's our practical guide to successful federation implementation.

## Why Federation Matters

Federation solves several critical challenges:

- Decentralized schema ownership
- Independent service deployment
- Unified API gateway
- Type-safe cross-service queries

## Implementation Strategy

Our proven approach includes:

1. Start with service boundaries definition
2. Implement entity resolution patterns
3. Design cross-service relationships
4. Set up composition validation

## Performance Optimization

Key metrics we've achieved:

- 40% reduction in response times
- 60% decrease in gateway CPU usage
- Improved cache hit rates
- Better development velocity

## Common Challenges

Watch out for these issues:

- N+1 query problems
- Schema composition conflicts
- Entity resolution bottlenecks
- Cross-service transaction handling

Next week, I'll share our custom federation directives that have helped solve complex cross-service data requirements.
